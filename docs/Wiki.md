Writing mods for any game can be a challenging task for beginners, especially without proper documentation. If you decide to start expanding the capabilities of Project Zomboid, we will try to help you with this. First of all, we recommend reading [the basics](https://github.com/cocolabs/pz-modding-guide#writing-code) on writing modifications.

Flux Loader provides many more features than it might seem at first glance. You can familiarize yourself with all internal processes through the source code, and you can find [example plugin](https://github.com/xLorey/FluxLoader-PluginTemplate) in our GitHub profile.

We also highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with these resources, they will greatly help you understand the logic of the game:
