# Contribute
We welcome any help in the development of this project! How can you help:
- Test - install the loader and just play. Mods are not necessary to install, so you will help find hidden bugs.  If something turns up, please report it to Issue so that other developers know what needs to be fixed.
- Create mods is a good way to develop our community and bring new functionality to the game.
- Take part in the development - you can always create a fork and make corrections by sending them for acceptance (pull request).
- Join our community at discord - we want to create a healthy community of enthusiastic developers where everyone can learn something and find new friends.
