 * Description: A custom class loader for loading plugin classes.
 *              Extends {@link URLClassLoader} to provide functionality for loading classes from a URL, such as a JAR file.
 *              <p>This class loader is specifically designed to work with plugins, allowing classes to be dynamically loaded
 *              and accessed during runtime. It also includes a method to check if a class has already been loaded, which helps
 *              prevent duplicate loading of the same class.</p>
