 * Description: Interface for implementing a new command.
 *              Implementing classes must use the @CommandName annotation to specify the command name.
 *              They may also use the @UserAccessLevel annotation to specify the required access level for the command.
 *              The @CommandChatReturn annotation can be used to provide text that will be displayed in chat when the command is invoked.
 *              The @CommandExecutionScope annotation should be used to define where the command is available (e.g., in chat, in console, or both).
